                    <p>Clever and curious Gemini is a sign that thinks fast, communicates well, and is full of ideas. Their versatility and adaptability stem from their split personality -- part intellect, part scatterbrained! The Twins are powered by information and feel most at home when sharing thoughts and conversations with others. Gemini is like a sponge, soaking up as much information as they possibly can. Whether it’s through reading, talking, or writing, Gemini’s thirst for knowledge is constant. As the most talkative sign of the zodiac, the Twins are known to be social, and are always on the lookout for a good time. Thriving on variety, you never know what you’ll get with Gemini!</p>
